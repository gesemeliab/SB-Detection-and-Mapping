- **Configuration**: 0 parameters → 15+ configurable parameters
- **Error Handling**: Minimal → Comprehensive (every input validated)

### Qualitative Improvements
- Hardcoded values → ROS parameter server
- Global mutable state → Encapsulated objects
- Print statements → Structured ROS logging
- Silent failures → Explicit error messages
- No type hints → Full type coverage
